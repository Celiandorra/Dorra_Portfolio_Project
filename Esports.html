                <h1> <span>Esports beginnings</span></h1>

                <p>According to the definition in the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, an Esport is “a video game
                    played as a competition for people to watch as entertainment”.<br>
                    The term is often perceived as modern and recent, but few know that the concept, as we know it,
                    existed since the 1970s and evolved throughout the decades to become the Esports of today.<br>
                    So where did it all begin?<br></p>
                <p class="space"></p>

                <p>Well the first two-player game ever made was “Tennis for Two” in the mid 1950s, and that was
                    considered as the first step for competitive gaming.<br>
                    Moving to the sixties, scoring systems were starting to get implemented and therefore competitive
                    spirits were rising. So tournaments were needed.<br>
                    “Spacewar!”, a game launched in 1962 with a pretty simple concept: just two people with a ship
                    fighting, was a revolutionary game for the gaming industry, and it continued receiving awards up
                    until 40 years after launch.
                <p class="space"></p>

                </p>
                <p>Indeed, with its rising popularity, the first ever Esport tournament was established.<br>
                    It was on October the 19th, 1972, that the first ever video game tournament was held. Participants
                    in the sci-fi rocket combat game “Spacewar” gathered to compete at the Stanford Artificial
                    Intelligence Lab in Los Altos, California, which was one of the few locations in the world at the
                    time with hardware advanced enough to operate the game. The winner of the world’s first video game
                    tournament received a free subscription to Rolling Stone and the bragging rights of holding the
                    title of “the Intergalactic Spacewar Champion of 1972”.<br>
                    The tournament’s organizer Stewart Brand ended up being featured on the Rolling Stones magazine with
                    a 9,000-word feature in the December 1972 issue, which not only praised the tournament but also
                    started popularizing video games since not many people even knew that video games existed.<br>

                <h1>LAN & Online</h1>

                <p>Decades passed, the gaming industry evolved with many new technologies and so did tournaments.
                    Streaming platforms are recognized by everyone nowadays, and esports are as televised as a normal
                    sport with a solid fanbase. Tournaments branched into two main types: LAN (I’m sure my millennial
                    friends know what this stands for) and online.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="space"></p>

                <p>LAN stands for local access network, or in simpler words, the players are gathered in the same room
                    and connected to the same network. These kind of tournaments are usually held in arenas, with
                    spectators and livestreams on platforms such as Twitch or YouTube.<br>
                    Most notable tournaments with a LAN structure are Dota2: The International, League of Legends World
                    Championship, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Majors.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="space"></p>

                <p>Opposed to online events where players are in different locations while connecting over the internet
                    to a server in another location. They usually have to rely on their home computers and personal
                    internet connections.<br>
                    Most notable tournaments with an online structure are Overwatch League, Call of Duty League (CDL),
                    and Rainbow Six Siege Pro League.<br>
                </p>

                <p class="space"></p>

                <p>You may be wondering which of the two is better?<br>
                    Well, naturally both structures come with pros and cons, so let’s compare them:<br>
                </p>


                LAN VS ONLINE<br>
                LET THE FIGHT BEGIN!<br>

            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="scrollHalf__group" data-scroll>
            <div class="scrollHalf__group__image">
                <img src="img/esports.jpg" />
            </div>
            <div class="scrollHalf__group__content">
                <h1>LAN vs Online</h1>
                <p>On one side we have LAN, with a stable network thats provided by the organizers, a high competitive
                    integrity since all the players are present in one place, and reduced online risks and attacks which
                    are usually associated with online play.
                    Not to mention that it offers a full immersive experience with live audiences and cheering,
                    elaborate productions, themed sets and arenas, and a livelier atmosphere. <br>
                    LAN tournaments are considered safer and more cheat-proof since a controlled environment is provided
                    with strict security measures to ensure fair play and prevent unauthorized interference.<br>
                </p>


                <p>On the downside though, LAN can be costly for participants, as they need to cover expenses related to
                    travel, accommodation, and event tickets. Many do not have the privilege of being able to attend
                    these tournaments.<br>
                    Arenas tend to get quite loud and noisy as well, which hinders communication between players as they
                    are not able to hear each other.
                    Not to mention that finding an appropriate venue that can accommodate a large number of players,
                    spectators, and production equipment is not an easy task. The venue must also meet technical
                    requirements for networking and power.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="space"></p>


                <p>Moving on to the opposing side, online tournaments offer the experience from the comfort of your home
                    with little to none expenses. It is more accessible to a wider range of players and spectators, as
                    they can participate from anywhere with a stable internet connection. This reduces the financial and
                    geographical barriers to entry.<br>
                    It is cost effective to event organizers as well since they don’t have to rent venues or provide
                    physical infrastructure.
                    Online tournaments have high adaptability and can mold to unforeseen circumstances, and we can
                    notice that pattern with the past Covid-19 pandemic, where we witnessed a rise with online Esports
                    with March’s viewership on the popular video game streaming platform Twitch rising by 23 percent,
                    which amounts to about 1.2 billion hours of video games watched. <br>
                </p>

                <p>Unfortunately, internet access can be quite poor or limited depending on the area, which causes
                    issues with lag or disconnections, which can significantly affect the fairness and competitiveness
                    of the matches.<br>
                    Also, online tournaments rely on player’s honesty and anti-cheating softwares which are not always
                    accurate, therefore there is always a risk of cheating or unsportsmanlike conduct.<br>
                    Add to that, production and broadcasting teams are required to deliver a professional and engaging
                    viewer experience. Coordinating these aspects remotely can be complex and tedious.<br>
                </p>


                <p>Creating an interactive and engaging experience for online viewers, including live commentary, viewer
                    chat, and social media engagement, is crucial to a tournament's success and must be conceptualized
                    beforehand.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="space"></p>

                <p>So we’re back to the question: which is better?<br>
                    The answer is simple really. It depends on the user’s preference!<br>
                    As we’ve seen some forms of tournaments are simply more accessible or convenient to certain people
                    therefore they will make their choices accordingly.<br>
                    Both forms are still implemented nowadays so that says something about their viability.
                </p>
                <p class="space"></p>
                <p>No matter the form, Esports have taken its spot among regular sports and have accumulated a wide
                    fanbase that spans all over the globe.<br>
